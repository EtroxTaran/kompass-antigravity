# UI/UX Documentation and GitHub UI Reference Synchronization

## CRITICAL RULE: GitHub UI Reference First

**When ANY UI/UX change is made, you MUST:**

1. ✅ **Check GitHub UI reference repository** (`EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek`) for existing patterns
2. ✅ **Update the documentation** in `ui-ux/` directory
3. ✅ **Document which reference components/patterns were used**

**NEVER implement UI without checking the GitHub UI reference repository first. The reference repository is the canonical source of truth.**

---

## When This Rule Applies

This rule is MANDATORY when:

### Component Changes
- Adding new UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Modifying existing component behavior or appearance
- Changing component props, variants, or states
- Adding/removing component features
- Changing component sizing, spacing, or layout

### Form Changes
- Adding new form fields
- Removing or hiding form fields
- Changing field types (e.g., textarea → rich text editor)
- Modifying field validation rules
- Changing field layout or grouping
- Adding conditional fields
- Changing form sections or tabs

### Layout Changes
- Modifying page layouts
- Changing navigation structure
- Adding/removing sidebars or panels
- Changing responsive breakpoints
- Modifying grid systems

### Design System Changes
- Color palette updates
- Typography changes
- Spacing/sizing system modifications
- Shadow or border radius changes
- Icon set updates

### Accessibility Changes
- ARIA label modifications
- Keyboard navigation updates
- Focus indicator changes
- Touch target size adjustments

---

## Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Check GitHub UI Reference Repository

**ALWAYS check the reference repository FIRST using GitHub MCP:**

1. **List directories** in `EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek` to understand structure
2. **Identify matching components/pages** that correspond to what you need to implement
3. **Read relevant files** to understand:
   - Component structure and props
   - Layout patterns
   - Styling conventions (CSS, Tailwind, tokens)
   - Naming conventions
   - Interaction patterns
   - Code conventions

**If a required element seems missing:**
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
- **ASK the user** for clarification
- **DO NOT** invent missing components or patterns
- **DO NOT** attempt to guess the intended design

### Step 2: Update Documentation Files

Update the relevant markdown files in `ui-ux/`:

```
ui-ux/
├── 01-foundation/           # Design system changes
├── 02-core-components/      # Component changes
├── 03-entity-forms/         # Form changes
├── 04-list-views/           # List/table changes
├── 05-detail-pages/         # Detail view changes
├── 06-dashboards/           # Dashboard changes
├── 07-mobile/               # Mobile-specific changes
└── 08-specialized/          # Specialized component changes
```

**Documentation MUST include:**
- Exact component specifications (size, spacing, colors) from reference
- State variations (default, hover, active, disabled) from reference
- Accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts) from reference
- Mobile considerations (touch targets, responsive behavior) from reference
- German labels and placeholder text
- Max character limits and validation rules
- **Reference source**: Which file/component from `EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek` was used

### Step 3: Document Reference Usage

**Document which reference components/patterns were used:**

- List the specific files from the reference repository
- Note any adaptations made to match our stack (React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
- Document any deviations from the reference (with justification)
- Include links to the reference repository files

---

## Implementation Workflow

### When Making UI/UX Changes

1. **Check GitHub UI Reference Repository**
   - Use GitHub MCP to fetch files from `EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek`
   - Identify matching components/pages
   - Read component source code, layout structures, styling conventions
   - Understand structure, props, patterns, naming, logic

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update all relevant markdown files in `ui-ux/`
   - Include exact specifications from reference
   - Document which reference files were used
   - Update examples and screenshots
   - Note any adaptations or deviations

3. **Implement Code**
   - Mirror/adapt patterns from reference repository
   - Rebuild using our stack (React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
   - Match reference patterns precisely
   - Use ShadCN to generate components matching reference structure

4. **Verify Compliance**
   - Ensure implementation matches reference patterns
   - Verify all specifications are complete
   - Check for ambiguities
   - Ensure documentation is comprehensive

## Examples of Changes Requiring Reference Check

### Example 1: Adding Customer Form

**Reference Check:**
- ✅ Fetched `src/components/CustomerForm.tsx` from `EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek`
- ✅ Inspected form structure, field layout, validation patterns
- ✅ Reviewed styling conventions and spacing

**Documentation Update:**
- ✅ Updated `ui-ux/03-entity-forms/customer-form.md`
- ✅ Documented reference source: `src/components/CustomerForm.tsx` from reference repo
- ✅ Included exact specifications from reference
- ✅ Noted adaptations for shadcn/ui components

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Rebuilt using shadcn/ui Form, Input, Button components
- ✅ Matched reference layout and spacing
- ✅ Applied reference validation patterns

### Example 2: Adding Dashboard Layout

**Reference Check:**
- ✅ Fetched `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` from reference repository
- ✅ Inspected layout structure, grid system, component placement
- ✅ Reviewed responsive breakpoints

**Documentation Update:**
- ✅ Updated `ui-ux/06-dashboards/adm-dashboard.md`
- ✅ Documented reference source: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` from reference repo
- ✅ Included layout specifications from reference

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Rebuilt using shadcn/ui Card, Grid components
- ✅ Matched reference grid system and spacing
- ✅ Applied reference responsive patterns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG: Implementing Without Checking Reference

```
✗ Implemented customer form without checking reference repository
✗ Created new UI patterns not present in reference
✗ Implementation doesn't match reference patterns!
```

### ❌ WRONG: Inventing Missing Patterns

```
✗ Couldn't find component in reference repository
✗ Invented new pattern without asking user
✗ Should have asked for clarification first!
```

### ❌ WRONG: Not Documenting Reference Source

```
✗ Updated ui-ux/03-entity-forms/customer-form.md
✗ Did NOT document which reference file was used
✗ Cannot verify implementation matches reference!
```

### ✅ CORRECT: Complete Reference-Based Implementation

```
✓ Fetched CustomerForm.tsx from EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek
✓ Inspected structure, props, patterns, styling
✓ Updated ui-ux/03-entity-forms/customer-form.md
✓ Documented reference source: src/components/CustomerForm.tsx
✓ Rebuilt using shadcn/ui matching reference patterns
✓ Implementation matches reference precisely
```

## Reference Repository Workflow

### Using GitHub MCP for UI Reference

**Step 1: List Repository Structure**
```
Use GitHub MCP to list directories in EtroxTaran/Kompassuimusterbibliothek
Identify component directories, page directories, style directories
```

**Step 2: Find Matching Components**
```
Search for components matching your needs
Read component files to understand structure
Inspect layout files for page patterns
```

**Step 3: Extract Patterns**
```
Read component source code
Understand props, structure, styling
Note naming conventions
Understand interaction patterns
```

**Step 4: Document Reference**
```
Document which reference files were used
Note any adaptations made
Document deviations (with justification)
```
